This project is a simple rock paper scissors game that is intended to be secured on-chain so nobody could try to get advantage against other players. It is focused in the security aspect more than the complexity of the game.

TODO list:
    - DecryptChoice function
    - CheckResult function
    - Distribute tokens when winning the game
    - The entire UI for the interaction
